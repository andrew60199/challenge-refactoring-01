# challenge-refactoring-01

## Description

Tasked with some code refactoring, this attempt has helped develop my skills towards becoming a full stack developer.

The code needed a little work, I had to fix the HTML semantics and add in alternative text to improve accessiblity.

It was also a fresher in the GitHub version control workflow.

## Usage

Above is a screenshot of what the final product looks like. But the real improvements can be seen in the HTML and CSS files.
